# LLM Fine-Tuning Tutorial

A comprehensive guide to fine-tuning language models using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for beginners.

## 📚 Contents

- **`Fine-Tuning-LLM-Tutorial.md`** - Complete Medium-style article with step-by-step instructions
- **`LLM_Fine_Tuning_Tutorial.ipynb`** - Hands-on Jupyter notebook with executable code

## 🚀 Quick Start with Google Colab

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/LLM_finetuning/blob/main/LLM_Fine_Tuning_Tutorial.ipynb)

1. Click the "Open in Colab" badge above
2. Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU (T4 or better recommended)
3. Run the cells step by step

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Choose and load appropriate base models
- Prepare instruction datasets for training
- Set up LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning
- Train models with minimal computational resources
- Test and interact with your fine-tuned model
- Save and share your results

## 💡 Why LoRA?

- **90% less memory usage** compared to full fine-tuning
- **Faster training times**
- **Easy experimentation** with different tasks
- **Runs on consumer hardware** including free Colab

## 🛠️ Requirements

```bash
pip install transformers>=4.44.0 datasets>=2.19.0 peft accelerate bitsandbytes sentencepiece
```

## 📖 Tutorial Structure

1. **Environment Setup** - Install dependencies and configure settings
2. **Model Selection** - Choose appropriate base models
3. **Data Preprocessing** - Format instruction datasets
4. **LoRA Configuration** - Set up parameter-efficient training
5. **Training** - Fine-tune your model
6. **Testing & Inference** - Interact with your trained model
7. **Saving & Sharing** - Preserve and distribute your work
