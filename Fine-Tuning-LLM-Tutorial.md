# Fine-Tuning Your First LLM: A Beginner's Complete Guide with LoRA

*Learn how to fine-tune a small open-source language model step-by-step, making AI accessible for everyone*

---

## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how to customize a language model for your specific needs? Maybe you want an AI that responds in a particular style, understands your domain-specific terminology, or follows certain instruction patterns. The good news is that you don't need massive computational resources or a PhD in machine learning to get started.

In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll walk through fine-tuning a small open-source language model from Hugging Face using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) — a parameter-efficient technique that makes fine-tuning accessible to anyone with a basic GPU or even Google Colab.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to:
- Choose and load an appropriate base model
- Prepare instruction datasets for training
- Set up LoRA for efficient fine-tuning
- Train your model with minimal resources
- Test and interact with your fine-tuned model
- Save and share your results

## Why LoRA Changes Everything

Traditional fine-tuning requires updating all model parameters, which is computationally expensive and memory-intensive. LoRA revolutionizes this by only training small "adapter" matrices while keeping the original model frozen. This means:

- **90% less memory usage**
- **Faster training times**
- **Easy to experiment with different tasks**
- **Can run on consumer hardware**

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Google Colab account (free tier works!) or local machine with GPU
- Enthusiasm to learn!

---

## Step 0: Environment Setup

First, let's install all the necessary libraries. If you're using Google Colab, simply run this in a cell:

```bash
pip -q install "transformers>=4.44.0" "datasets>=2.19.0" peft accelerate bitsandbytes sentencepiece
```

**Key Libraries Explained:**
- **transformers**: Hugging Face's main library for language models
- **datasets**: Easy loading and processing of training data
- **peft**: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (includes LoRA)
- **accelerate**: Optimizes training across different hardware
- **bitsandbytes**: Enables low-precision training for memory efficiency

---

## Step 1: Choosing Your Base Model

For this tutorial, we'll start with `distilgpt2` — a smaller, faster version of GPT-2 that's perfect for learning. It trains quickly and still produces coherent text.

```python
BASE_MODEL = "distilgpt2"  # Small & fast for demos
EOS_TOKEN = "</s>"         # End-of-sequence token we'll append to targets
```

**Why Start Small?**
- Faster iterations while learning
- Lower memory requirements
- Easier to debug issues
- You can scale up to larger models later

---

## Step 2: Loading the Training Dataset

We'll use the famous Alpaca dataset, which contains instruction-response pairs perfect for teaching models to follow directions.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

ds = load_dataset("yahma/alpaca-cleaned")
print(ds)
```

**Sample Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "instruction": "Explain the moon's phases simply.",
  "input": "",
  "output": "The Moon looks different over a month because we see different sunlit parts..."
}
```

This dataset is ideal because:
- Clean, high-quality examples
- Diverse instruction types
- Perfect for teaching instruction-following

---

## Step 3: Data Preprocessing Magic

This is where we transform raw data into something our model can learn from. We'll create a consistent prompt template:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(BASE_MODEL, use_fast=True)

# Handle models without explicit pad tokens
if tokenizer.pad_token is None:
    tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token

def format_example(example):
    """Convert each example into a training-ready format"""
    inst = example["instruction"].strip()
    inp  = example.get("input", "").strip()
    out  = example["output"].strip()

    if inp:
        prompt = f"### Instruction:\n{inst}\n\n### Input:\n{inp}\n\n### Response:\n"
    else:
        prompt = f"### Instruction:\n{inst}\n\n### Response:\n"

    # Complete training text = prompt + response + EOS
    text = prompt + out + EOS_TOKEN
    return {"text": text}

# Apply formatting to entire dataset
formatted = ds["train"].map(format_example, remove_columns=ds["train"].column_names)
```

**Why This Template Works:**
- Clear section markers (###) help the model understand structure
- Consistent formatting across all examples
- EOS tokens signal completion

---

## Step 4: Tokenization and Data Preparation

Now we convert text to numbers (tokens) that the model can process:

```python
# Create train/validation split
split = formatted.train_test_split(test_size=0.01, seed=42)
train_ds, val_ds = split["train"], split["test"]

MAX_LEN = 512  # Keep sequences manageable for demo

def tokenize(batch):
    """Convert text to tokens with proper padding/truncation"""
    return tokenizer(
        batch["text"],
        truncation=True,
        max_length=MAX_LEN,
        padding="max_length",
    )

# Tokenize both datasets
tokenized_train = train_ds.map(tokenize, batched=True, remove_columns=["text"])
tokenized_val   = val_ds.map(tokenize, batched=True, remove_columns=["text"])

# Prepare labels for causal language modeling
import numpy as np

def add_labels(batch):
    """For causal LM, labels are just input_ids with padding masked"""
    labels = np.array(batch["input_ids"])
    labels[np.array(batch["attention_mask"]) == 0] = -100  # Ignore padding in loss
    batch["labels"] = labels.tolist()
    return batch

tokenized_train = tokenized_train.map(add_labels, batched=True)
tokenized_val   = tokenized_val.map(add_labels, batched=True)
```

---

## Step 5: LoRA Configuration - The Secret Sauce

Here's where the magic happens. Instead of updating billions of parameters, we add small adapter matrices:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model, prepare_model_for_kbit_training

# Load model with optional 8-bit quantization for memory efficiency
bnb_kwargs = {}
try:
    from transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig
    bnb_kwargs["quantization_config"] = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)
except Exception:
    pass

device_map = "auto" if torch.cuda.is_available() else None

base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    BASE_MODEL,
    trust_remote_code=False,
    device_map=device_map,
    **bnb_kwargs
)

# Prepare for efficient training
if bnb_kwargs:
    base_model = prepare_model_for_kbit_training(base_model)

# LoRA configuration
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,                    # Rank of adaptation matrices (lower = fewer params)
    lora_alpha=32,           # Scaling factor
    target_modules=["c_attn"],  # Which layers to adapt (GPT-2 specific)
    lora_dropout=0.05,       # Dropout for regularization
    bias="none",
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM",
)

# Wrap base model with LoRA
model = get_peft_model(base_model, lora_config)
model.print_trainable_parameters()
```

**LoRA Parameters Explained:**
- **r (rank)**: Controls how many parameters we add. Lower = more efficient
- **lora_alpha**: Scales the adaptation. Usually 2x the rank
- **target_modules**: Which attention layers to modify
- **lora_dropout**: Prevents overfitting

---

## Step 6: Training Time!

Now we set up the training loop using Hugging Face Trainer:

```python
from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling, TrainingArguments, Trainer

data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    mlm=False  # Causal LM, not masked LM
)

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="distilgpt2-alpaca-lora",
    num_train_epochs=1,                  # Start small, increase later
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=4,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=4,       # Effective batch size = 16
    warmup_ratio=0.03,
    learning_rate=2e-4,                  # LoRA can handle higher learning rates
    weight_decay=0.0,
    logging_steps=50,
    evaluation_strategy="steps",
    eval_steps=200,
    save_steps=200,
    save_total_limit=2,
    bf16=torch.cuda.is_available(),      # Use bf16 on modern GPUs
    report_to="none",                    # Disable wandb/tensorboard for simplicity
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_train,
    eval_dataset=tokenized_val,
    data_collator=data_collator,
)

# Start training!
trainer.train()
```

**Training Tips:**
- Start with 1 epoch to see if everything works
- Monitor the loss curve — it should decrease steadily
- Evaluation loss tells you if you're overfitting
- Save checkpoints in case training is interrupted

## Step 7: Testing Your Fine-Tuned Model

The moment of truth! Let's see how well your model follows instructions:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Create a text generation pipeline with your fine-tuned model
gen = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    device=0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else -1
)

def build_prompt(instruction, inp=""):
    """Create properly formatted prompts for inference"""
    if inp:
        return f"### Instruction:\n{instruction}\n\n### Input:\n{inp}\n\n### Response:\n"
    else:
        return f"### Instruction:\n{instruction}\n\n### Response:\n"

# Test with a sample instruction
prompt = build_prompt("Explain the Moon's phases in one friendly paragraph for a 10-year-old.")
outputs = gen(
    prompt,
    max_new_tokens=128,
    do_sample=True,
    top_p=0.9,
    temperature=0.7
)

print(outputs[0]["generated_text"])
```

**Generation Parameters Explained:**
- **max_new_tokens**: How much text to generate
- **do_sample**: Use probabilistic sampling vs greedy
- **top_p**: Nucleus sampling for more diverse outputs
- **temperature**: Controls randomness (0.7 = creative but coherent)

---

## Step 8: Saving and Sharing Your Work

```python
# Save just the LoRA adapter (lightweight)
model.save_pretrained("distilgpt2-alpaca-lora/adapter")

# Or merge LoRA with base model for easy sharing
merged = model.merge_and_unload()
merged.save_pretrained("distilgpt2-alpaca-merged")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("distilgpt2-alpaca-merged")
```

**Storage Options:**
- **Adapter only**: ~10MB, requires base model
- **Merged model**: Full size, standalone
- **Hugging Face Hub**: Share with the community!
